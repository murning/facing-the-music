Facing The Music
==============================

## Binaural Sound Source Localisation Using Machine Learning

This repository serves to document my undergraduate thesis for a BscEng in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Cape Town. 

The following research question was proposed: 

* In comparison to using classical signal processing techniques, can deep learning
  be used in the task of binaural sound source localisation in order to
  develop a system that is robust to noise and reverberation? 
  
* Furthermore, can the deployment of this system on a rotating robotic platform improve localisation accuracy?


The final deliverable of this project was a robotic system that was capable of locating a sound source and rotating to face it. All research performed in this project is reproducible through the [explanatory notebooks](./src/notebooks/Facing The Music.ipynb).

About
--------------

The goal of this project was the implementation of a binaural sound source localisation
system using machine learning, with ultimate ends of deployment on a rotating robotic
platform. 

### Design and implementation

* A data synthesis methodology was designed and implemented. This method was used to generate large synthetic datasets for use    in machine learning. 
* Classical signal processing techniques were used to act as a comparative
  baseline for the machine learning techniques utilized herein.
* Three deep learning models were designed, trained and evaluated. 
* These models were used in conjunction with a rotation
  algorithm implemented on the recording apparatus. The use of a rotation algorithm,
  in which predictions are updated with each movement, allows 360 â—¦ localisation to take
  place. 

### Findings

* Experimentation showed that even though a useful model of binaural sound
  source localisation was developed, its performance with respect to noise and reverberation
rejection did not show a significant improvement upon the existing signal processing
method. 

* This being said, the deep learning model was successfully deployed on a hardware
system and was able to perform direction of arrival estimation with promising accuracy
in a controlled environment. 

* One of the most promising findings was that the system, which was trained entirely on synthesized data, was capable of    performing robust localisation in real environments when deployed on the hardware. 

This work presents a starting point for further research in pursuit of a robust, end-to-end, data-driven solution to binaural sound source localisation.

Getting Started
--------------------

If you wish to explore the work of this project, have a look throught the jupyter notebook Facing the Music. This notebook
walks through the logic of the system through the following steps:

* Data Synthesis
* Data Preprocessing
* Training
* Simulation

If you would like to play around and explore the code and simulations, you can run the jupyter notebook on your own 
machine as follows. 

```
git clone https://github.com/murning/facing-the-music && cd facing-the-music
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook ./src/notebooks/Facing The Music.ipynb
```

Note that synthesizing the dataset is rather computationally expensive. If you plan to synthesize a dataset of 50000+ points you will need a lot of ram and as many cores as you can get your hands on. I used a GCP instance with 12 cores and 60gb of ram.

If you wish to explore the hardware design, please see the *Design* chapter in my ![thesis](./report/undergraduate_thesis_kevin_murning.pdf)
